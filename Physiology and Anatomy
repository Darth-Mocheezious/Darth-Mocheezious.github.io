  <h3 class="backcolor"><b> Physiology and Anatomy </b></h3>
	<p>Muslim scientists contributed greatly to anatomy/physiology. Scientist Ibn Al-Nafis theorized that capillaries exist to connect veins and arteries, a prediction which was proven true about 400 years later. Al-Jahiz's works were used to develop the theories of evolution and natural selection. Muslim scientists theorized about the nervous system and their theories were mostly true.  </p>
