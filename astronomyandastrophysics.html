	 <p>Astronomy was a very important thing to Muslims; Muslims used the Sun to tell time and to know when to pray, and used the moon to know when the months began/ended. The astrolabe was made in ancient Greece, but Muslims scientists made it better. Muslim scientists also discovered many of the stars and constellations.   </p>
