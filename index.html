	<h3 style="text-align:center"><b> Astronomy and Astrophysics </b></h3>
	 <p>Astronomy was a very important thing to Muslims; Muslims used the Sun to tell time and to know when to pray, and used the moon to know when the months began/ended. The astrolabe was made in ancient Greece, but Muslims scientists made it better. Muslim scientists also discovered many of the stars and constellations.   </p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center"><b> Physiology and Anatomy </b></h3>
	<p>Muslim scientists contributed greatly to anatomy/physiology. Scientist Ibn Al-Nafis theorized that capillaries exist to connect veins and arteries, a prediction which was proven true about 400 years later. Al-Jahiz's works were used to develop the theories of evolution and natural selection. Muslim scientists theorized about the nervous system and their theories were mostly true.  </p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center"><b> Geography and Geology </b></h3>
	<p>Muslim scientist Al-Biruni made the most accurate estimate of the Earth's radius; 6339.6 km. Famous cartographer Al-Idrisi made the most accurate world map at the time, and was invited to many courts to share his maps. Muslim scientists said that the Earth was not flat, which has been proven correct  </p>

	<p>Muslims invented the symbol for 0. Al-Kharazimi is credited with the father of algebra. Muslim mathematicians made many maths. Muslims contributed greatly to geometry, trignometry, and calculus.  </p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center"><b> Medicine </b></h3>
	<p>The very first Muslim hospital was in built in Baghdad in 805.
